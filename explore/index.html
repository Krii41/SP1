            <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, 
                there's plenty to see and do.
            </p>
            <p>You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in 
                time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible 
                for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.

            <p>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children 
                your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore.
