            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and 
                ready for visitors to come and enjoy. </p>
            <p>Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, 
                access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come 
                together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
            </p>
            <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you'd like to 
                find out more about how you can get involved.
